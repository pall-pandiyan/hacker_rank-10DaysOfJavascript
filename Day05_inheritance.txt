Objective

In this challenge, we practice implementing inheritance and use JavaScript prototypes to add a new method to an existing prototype. Check out the attached Classes tutorial to refresh what we've learned about these topics.

Task

We provide the implementation for a Rectangle class in the editor. Perform the following tasks:

    Add an area method to Rectangle's prototype.
    Create a Square class that satisfies the following:
        It is a subclass of Rectangle.
        It contains a constructor and no other methods.
        It can use the Rectangle class' area method to print the area of a Square object.

Locked code in the editor tests the class and method implementations and prints the area values to STDOUT.
